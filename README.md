# wildfirewatch
GitHub repo for our ElleHacks 2023 project! WildfireWatch uses predictive modelling on real historical wildfire data to predict the likelihood of wildfires occurring around a given date and in a given area - early awareness allows for more time to plan your next move, whether it's to evacuate or to simply prepare resources for an occurrence.

This website runs locally (open `index.html` in your browser). The website is interactable from that point on and will route to other pages like a regular site!

Code styling and resources are in the `css ` and `images` folder. The predictive model is built with Python and is stored on Colab as well as in the `wildfirewatchfinal.py` Python file.
